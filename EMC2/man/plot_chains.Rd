\usage{
plot_chains(
  pmwg_mcmc,
  layout = NA,
  subject = NA,
  ylim = NULL,
  selection = "alpha",
  filter = "sample",
  thin = 1,
  subfilter = 0,
  plot_acf = FALSE,
  acf_chain = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pmwg_mcmc}{A list of samplers or samplers converted to mcmc objects.}

\item{layout}{A vector or matrix specifying the layout as in par(mfrow = layout).}

\item{subject}{A string or integer which you can specify to only plot chains of that subject.}

\item{ylim}{The y limits of the chain plot.}

\item{selection}{a string. Specifies which chains you want to plot.}

\item{filter}{a string. Specifies which stage you want to plot.}

\item{thin}{an integer. Specify if you want to thin the chains by a factor n.}

\item{subfilter}{an integer or vector. If integer it will exclude up until that integer. If vector it will include everything in that range.}

\item{plot_acf}{bool. If TRUE will also plot autocorrelation for the chain specified in acf_chain.}

\item{acf_chain}{an integer. For which chain to plot the acf, if plot_acf = TRUE.}
