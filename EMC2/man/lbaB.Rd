\title{The Linear Ballistic Accumulator (LBA) model}
\usage{
lbaB()
}
\description{
The Linear Ballistic Accumulator, proposes that for each choice alternative, ballistic accumulators race towards a common bound.
The first accumulator to reach the bound determines the choice made. The time taken to reach the threshold determines the response times. For details see \verb{Brown & Heathcote, 2008}
}
\details{
The core parameters of the LBA are the drift rate \code{v}, the response threshold \code{B},
between trial variation in drift rate \code{sv}, between trial variation in startpoint of the drift rate \code{A}, and non-decision time \code{t0}.
Frequently \code{sv} is fixed to 1 to satisfy scaling constraints.

Here we use the b = B + A parameterization, which ensures that the response threshold is always higher than the between trial variation in start point of the drift rate.
