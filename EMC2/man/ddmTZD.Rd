\description{
The Diffusion Decision Model, proposes that decisions between two alternatives are determined based on one accumulator.
This accumulator drifts to an upper threshold or a lower threshold. The first threshold it reaches determines the choice made.
The time taken to reach the threshold drives the response time. For details see \verb{Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008}.
}
\details{
The core parameters of the DDM are the drift rate \code{v}, the boundary separation \code{a},
within trial variation in drift rate \code{s}, bias to either threshold \code{Z}, and non-decision time \code{t0}.
Frequently \code{s} is fixed to 1 to satisfy scaling constraints.
Furthermore, we can estimate between trial variation in drift rate \code{sv}, non-decision time \code{st0}, and bias \code{SZ}. Note that computing for these parameters is slower.
Lastly \code{DP} comprises the difference in non-decision time for each response option.

We sample \verb{a, t0, sv, st0, s} on the log scale because these parameters should be strictly positive
We sample \verb{Z, SZ and DP} on the probit scale because they should be strictly between 0 and 1.
Here \code{Z} is estimated as the ratio of bias to one boundary, where 0 is complete bias to lower boundary and 1 complete bias to upper boundary
\code{DP} is estimated as a ratio of lower/higher \code{t0} relative to the \verb{t0 parameter}
