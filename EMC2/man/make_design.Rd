make_design(
  Flist = NULL,
  Ffactors = NULL,
  Rlevels = NULL,
  model,

\arguments{
\item{Flist}{A list. Contains the design formula of the type list(y ~ x).}

\item{Ffactors}{A named list. Participant factor and all factors used in design formulas that are defined as factors in the data frame to be fit.

Must use "subjects" as name for participant factor. For others don't use "trial", "R", "rt", "lR", or "lM".
Also refrain from using "_" as factor names.}

\item{Rlevels}{A character vector. Contains the response factor levels.}

\item{model}{A function, Specifies the model type.}

\item{Clist}{A list. Contrast list.}

\item{matchfun}{A function. Specifies whether a response was correct or not.

Example: \code{function(d)d$S==d$lR}}

\item{constants}{A named vector. Sets constants. Any parameter named by \code{sampled_p_vector} can be set constant.}

\item{Fcovariates}{Covariate factors. Covariate measures which may be included in the model and/or mapped to factors.}

\item{Ffunctions}{Factor Functions. Functions to specify specific parameterisations, or functions of parameters.}

\item{adapt}{For future compatibility. Ignore.}

\item{report_p_vector}{TRUE (default) or FALSE. if TRUE, returns the vector of parameters to be estimated.}

\item{custom_p_vector}{A character vector. If specified, a custom likelihood function can be supplied.}
}
\value{
A design list.
}
\description{
This function returns a list with the model design.
